The CSS code contains an invalid or unsupported property or value, which is not caught by most browsers' developer tools.  For example, using a property that's specific to a particular browser or an older version of a browser but not widely supported.  Another possibility is a typo in a property name or value, leading to unexpected behavior without throwing an error.
